This shows the duality of computation to be more fundamental than the logic of computation for which choice is disjunction and concurrency conjunction.",

We show that the usual interleaving equivalences, and also the equivalences based on steps (multisets of concurrently executed actions) are not preserved by refinement of atomic actions. We prove that ''linear time'' partial order semantics, where causality in runs is explicit, is invariant under refinement. Finally, we consider various bisimulation equivalences based on partial orders and show that the strongest one of them is preserved by refinement whereas the others are not.",

pages="156--165",
abstract="The paper presents the LTL preserving stubborn set method for reducing the amount of work needed in the automatic verification of concurrent systems with respect to linear time temporal logic specifications. The method facilitates the generation of reduced state spaces such that the truth values of a collection of linear temporal logic formulas are the same in the ordinary and reduced state spaces. The only restrictions posed by the method are that the collection of formulas must be known before the reduced state space generation is commenced, the use of the temporal operator ``next'' is prohibited, and the (reduced) state space of the system must be finite. The method cuts down the number of states by utilising the fact that in concurrent systems the nett result of the occurrence of two events is often independent of the order of occurrence.",

The class of $\omega$-regular languages is closed under a fair concurrency operator. A general method for proving/deciding equivalences between such languages is obtained, derived from Milner's notion of ``simulation''.",
