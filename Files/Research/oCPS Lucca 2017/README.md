# 7th oCPS PhD School on "Cyber-Physical Systems"

The design of next generation of smart electricity grids, intelligent transportation, and of many other systems requires a tight coordination between computation, communication and control elements (the cyber part) on the one hand, and physical processes such as heating, cooling, motion, vibrations, etc. (the physical part) on the other hand. Despite the need for integrated design of these so-called Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the corresponding scientific disciplines (control, computer science, etc.) have predominantly developed independently. Novel system architectures and systematic design methods are needed to realize the integrated design of the CPS of the future.

Particular attention was given to:

- Discrete-event and hybrid systems techniques for CPS
- Resource-aware control
- Formal methods for embedded control
- Security in control of CPS
- Model predictive control
- Approximate dynamic programming
- Machine learning and reinforcement learning
- Fault-tolerant control of distributed CPS
- Multi-agent systems
- Industrial perspectives on CPS
- Poster - 7th oCPS PhD School

The program included four days of lectures, 7 hours of 45min each day (only first and last day less hours), covering the main concepts, results and contributions in the area of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Topics included control over communication networks, security of CPS, resource-aware control, embedded control, embedded optimisation and MPC, formal methods in control, multi-agent systems, etc, etc.. These topics were taught be leading researchers in the field.

The idea of the school is to initiate young graduate students into the field of CPS, therefore we expect the lectures to be as much didactic as possible, possibly sacrificing the presentation of the most recent results in favor of a clear and deep exposition of the basic ones. As such, the presentations has been in a lecture style (providing explanations, insights and overviews) rather than in a workshop/conference style.

# About the school

oCPS is a Training Network (Marie Curie) receiving funding from the European Union’s 2020 framework programme for research and innovation under grant agreement no 674875, see more on ocps.ele.tue.nl. The main objective of the Platform-aware Model-driven Optimization of Cyber-Physical Systems (oCPS) program is to form a multi-disciplinary research and education network bringing together all disciplines relevant for CPS to form a scientific basis to (i) develop model-driven design techniques for CPS and (ii) introduce platform-awareness in the design trajectories. Such techniques should allow dealing with tradeoffs towards cost-effective, quality-driven, reliable design of the CPS of the future. The program aims to train a generation of young researchers in cross-disciplinary thinking and deliver industrially validated tool chains. 

The oCPS PhD school on Cyber-Physical Systems is also the 7th edition of a series of biannual PhD schools with a focus on hybrid, networked and large-scale systems, that educated over 500 PhD students worldwide:

- “0th” DISC PhD School on Hybrid Systems in 2003 (organized by M. Heemels, B. De Schutter, A. Bemporad)
- 1st HYCON PhD School on Hybrid Systems in 2005 (organized by A. Bemporad, M. Heemels)
- 2nd HYCON PhD School on Hybrid Systems in 2007 (organized by A. Bemporad, M. Heemels)
- 3rd WIDE PhD school on Networked Systems in 2009 (organized by A. Bemporad, M. Heemels, M. Johansson)
- 4th HYCON2 PhD school on Control of Networked and Large-Scale Systems in 2011 (organized by A. Bemporad, M. Heemels)
- 5th HYCON2 PhD School on Control of Networked and Large-Scale Systems in 2013 (organized by A. Bemporad, M. Heemels, M. Johansson)
- 6th DISC Summer School on Control for Cyber-Physical Systems, in 2015 (organized by A. Bemporad, M. Heemels)
