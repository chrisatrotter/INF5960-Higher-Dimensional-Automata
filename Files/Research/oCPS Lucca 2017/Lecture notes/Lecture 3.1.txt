#### Abstraction ####
The emergence of interconnected cyber-physical systems and sensor/actuator networks has given rise to advanced automation applications, where a large amount of sensor data is collected and processed in order to make suitable real-time decisions and to achieve the desired control objectives. However, in situations where some components behave abnormally or become faulty, this may lead to serious degradation in performance or even to catastrophic system failures, especially due to cascaded effects of the interconnected subsystems. The goal of this presentation is to motivate the need for health monitoring, fault diagnosis and security of interconnected cyber-physical systems and to provide a methodology for designing and analyzing fault-tolerant cyber-physical systems with complex nonlinear dynamics. Various detection, isolation and accommodation algorithms will be presented and illustrated, and directions for future research will be discussed.

Fault Diagnosis of Interconnected Cyber Physical Systems

Motivation for fault diagnosis

The smart revolution:
	Smart phones
	Smart cars
	Smart grids
	smart buildings
	smart cities
	smart camera networks
	smart water networks
	-> Smart-X

It tells us something about where the technology is advancing towards.

Hardware:
	- Sensing & actuation devices
	- Embedded computing
	- Wide area connectivity
Software:
	- Data management
	- Decision making algorithms
	- Learning algorithms
	- Optimization an control

From a software viewpoint, the advances have not been that amazing.
Decision making, learning is still at the young stage of advances.

Digital advances provide the ICT infrastructure not the INTELLIGENCE(so far)
Infrastructure will be further enchanced via the IoT.
Smart-X vs. Smart-ready-X

Control systems an machine learning are at the heart of tranforming the smart-X.

More proactive, more planning ahead
More discrete-event, more event-triggered
More machine learning, handling of larger volume of data, more heterogeneous data
Handling of more uncertainty, fault tolerance
Handling of human-machine interaction

Incorporating different forms of data need a better advancement.

Fragility 	- Wrong decisions escalation to a catastrophic failure
			- Fault propagation from one subsystem to another
			- Unrealiable and unstrustworthy automation procedures.

It is important that people trust the autonomous system, without that the
whole system is worthless since nobody will use it. No matter how great
the system might be.


Black Swan Theory - Nassim Nicholas Taleb
"Metaphor that describes an event that comes as a suprise, has a major effect, and is
often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight(extreme outliers)"

Supervisory algorithm

Fault scenarios
	- System/process faults
	- Actuator faults
	- Sensor faults
	- Communication faults
	- Controller faults
	- Environment faults
	- Malicious attacks(Cyber-security)(intentional)


Fault diagnosis steps:
	- fault detection
	- fault isolation
	- fault identification and risk assessment
	- fault accommodation

fault vs. modeling uncertainty(exploit spatial and temporal correlations)
How do you handle multiple faults? Can we use HDA? Event-structures? Modeling for fault diagnosis?
