Machine learning and Robotics research in CPS

Robot reinforcement learning

Challenges: Dimensionality
Real world evnironment
Exploration

Value-based reinforecement learning:
	Estimate value function:
		- Global estimate for all reachable sates
		- Hard to scale to high-D.
		- Approximations might "destroy" policy

Policy Search Methods
	Use aprametrized policy
	Correlated local exploration
	Locally optimal solutions

Gaussian distributions have nice properties that are local to the parameter space.

Contextual policy search vs. hierarchical policy search

Taxonomy of Policy search algorithms

Model-Free policy search methods
	- policy gradients
	- Natural gradients
	- Exact Information Geometric updates
	- Success matching

Policy search for Multi-Agent Systems

Taxonomy of policy search algorithms:
	- Trajectory-based vs. action-based.


Note: Get a undestanding of the parameter space: Is this the same notion as in programming? Functional approach?

Is it possible to start with trajectory-based and then slowly intergrate to action-based?
