# INF5960 - Higher-Dimensional Automata

The geometric model, Higher-dimensional automata (HDA), is a useful and general model for non-interleaving concurrency. In a non-interleaving approach to concurrency, more than one event may happen concurrently and one differentiates between concurrent and interleaving executions, satisfying ```math $a \parallel b \neq a.b + b.a$```. HDA also encompass all other commonly used models of concurrency. However, due to generality HDAs are challenging to work with. Vaughan Pratt introduced sculptures and Chu spaces as models which retain some of the good properties of HDA as well as being easier to work with. Recently, Johansen has introduced ST-structures as another event-based formalism for the same purpose.
